# FinalProject
## Overview
The project involves utalize equiment that uses scientific computations in order to create frequency graphs of a user-inputed .wav files. This is acheievd by the implimentation of a user-freindly GUI with a load button to upload the file. After a user inputs their .wav file or equivilant, the program will then display six unique grpahs. Theses graphs include waveform, low frequency, high frequency, mid frequency, a combined graph, and spectogram. This is achieved through using API and other Python library tools. 

## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to achievie a functional GUI that can accurately read a wav file and generate frequency graphs corrasponding with the inputed data while working with teammates. The project demonstrated how useful teamwork and colaboration is in modeling a real-world coding scenario. 

## Basic Usage Instructions
Make sure you have Pycharm or Python equivlant installed.
